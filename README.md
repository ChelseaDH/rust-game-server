# Rust Game Server

This project is a multiplayer game server implemented in Rust for the popular game Tic Tac Toe. 
The game is played in the terminal either locally or over the network.

## Why this project?

The purpose of this project is twofold; to showcase my ability with the Rust programming language and to dive deeper
into the world of multiplayer game development and networking.

By building this game server, I aim to:

1. **Learn and demonstrate Rust skills**: Rust is awesome! It's fast, safe, and concurrent. This project offers an
   opportunity to showcase my ability to write clean, efficient, and safe Rust code.
2. **Explore multiplayer games**: Building a multiplayer game server will involve designing a game protocol, handling
   multiple connections, and keeping everyone in sync. Through this project I will gain experience in networking,
   synchronization, and building scalable systems.
3. **Start simple with Tic Tac Toe**: While a simple game, Tic Tac Toe still poses interesting challenges when it
   comes to game logic and multiplayer interactions. By starting with Tic Tac Toe, I can focus on the networking and
   server-side aspects of the development.
